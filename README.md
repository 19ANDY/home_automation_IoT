In this project we are going to make a home automation system using ESP8266 WiFi module and Arduino Uno. Using this we will be able to control lights, electric fan and other home appliances through a web browser using your PC or mobile. These AC mains appliances will be connected to relays which are controlled by the Arduino. ESP8266 and Arduino together acts as a Web Server and we will send control commands through a Web Browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. ESP8266 is the one of the most popular and low cost wifi module available in the market today. You can ready more about it here, ESP8266 â€“ WiFi SoC.
